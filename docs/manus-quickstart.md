# Manus Quick Start

Get set up in 3 minutes and let Manus help you build real-time data assets.

---

## Step 1 -- Get an API Token

Go to the [GoalfyData Console](https://goalfydata.ai/settings) to create an API Key (in the format `gfk_xxx`).

The plaintext key is only shown once at creation time. Save it in a secure location.

## Step 2 -- Add MCP Connector (Tool)

Go to **Plugins** in the left sidebar -> click **Create** in the top right -> choose one of the two methods in the connector section:

### Option 1: Import MCP via JSON (Recommended)

Copy the following JSON, replace `gfk_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual token, paste it in, and save:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "goalfydata-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.goalfydata.ai/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer gfk_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Custom MCP

Fill in each field as follows:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Server Name** | `GoalfyData` |
| **Transport Type** | `HTTP` |
| **Server URL** | `https://mcp.goalfydata.ai/mcp` |
| **Custom Headers** | Name: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer gfk_your_actual_token` |

## Step 3 -- Upload Skill

Go to **Plugins** in the left sidebar -> click **Create** in the top right -> Skills section -> **Upload Skill**.

Manus requires uploading a `.zip` or `.skill` file with `SKILL.md` at the root level.

**Download pre-built ZIP**: Download [goalfydata-skill.zip](https://github.com/GoalfyAI/goalfydata/raw/main/manus/goalfydata-skill.zip) directly and skip to the upload step below.

**Or clone and package manually**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoalfyAI/goalfydata.git
cd goalfydata/manus/skill
zip -r goalfydata-skill.zip SKILL.md references/
```

Drag and drop the generated `goalfydata-skill.zip` into the upload area.

## Step 4 -- Verify

Once the connector status shows connected and `goalfydata` appears in Skills, say "List my datasets" in the chat to test.

If the connection fails:
- Confirm the server URL is correct
- Confirm the token is entered correctly, including the `Bearer ` prefix
- Manus runs in the cloud -- the URL must be publicly accessible

## Getting Started

Once verification passes, simply say in a Manus conversation:

### Create a Dataset from a File

```
Create a dataset from this CSV file
```

### Pull Data from an API

```
Create an e-commerce dataset, pull product and user data from the DummyJSON API
```

### Query Data

```
List my datasets
```

```
Query the first 10 rows from the orders table
```

### Share a Dataset

```
Share this dataset with xxx@example.com
```

## FAQ

### Connector Shows Error

1. The server URL must be publicly accessible (Manus runs in the cloud)
2. Check whether the token is incorrect or missing the `Bearer ` prefix
3. For transport type, start with `HTTP`. If that doesn't work, check whether Manus offers a `Streamable HTTP` option

### Skill Not Recognized

Confirm you uploaded a `.zip` file packaged from the `manus/skill/` directory, with `SKILL.md` at the root of the zip. Do not upload files from other platforms.

## Update

### Skill Update

MCP connector points to the remote service, no update needed. Skill files need to be manually updated:

1. Delete the old `goalfydata` Skill in the Skills management page
2. Download the latest [goalfydata-skill.zip](https://github.com/GoalfyAI/goalfydata/raw/main/manus/goalfydata-skill.zip) and re-upload
3. Close the current conversation and reopen (Skills are only loaded at session start)

```bash
uds-cli self-update
```
