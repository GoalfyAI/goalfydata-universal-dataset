### Commit Convention

- `refactor:` — Code refactoring
- `test:` — Test related

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoalfyAI/goalfydata.git
cd goalfydata
```

### Plugin Development

Each platform directory (`claude-code/`, `cursor/`, `codex/`) is self-contained. Local testing:

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./claude-code
```

**Cursor:**
```bash
cp -r ./cursor ~/.cursor/plugins/goalfydata
```

### Editing SKILL.md

When modifying SKILL.md or references, update all platform directories (`claude-code/`, `cursor/`, `codex/`, `manus/`, `generic/`) together. The Manus skill zip is automatically rebuilt by GitHub Actions when `manus/skill/` changes.
