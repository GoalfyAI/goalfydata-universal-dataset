# GoalfyData — Manus Integration

Manus is a cloud-based agent with two parts to configure separately: **Tools (MCP)** are added as a connector in the plugin page; **Skills** are uploaded as skill files.

## Step 1: Obtain API Token

Go to the [GoalfyData Console](https://goalfydata.ai/settings) to create an API Key (in the format `gfk_xxx`). The plaintext key is only shown once at creation time -- save it securely.

## Step 2: Add MCP Connector (Tools)

Go to **Plugins** in the left sidebar -> click **Create** in the top right -> in the Connector area, choose one of the two methods:

### Method A: Import MCP via JSON (recommended)

Click **Import MCP via JSON**, paste the following JSON, replace `gfk_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with your token, and save.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "goalfydata-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.goalfydata.ai/mcp",
      "transport": "streamable_http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer gfk_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Method B: Custom MCP (fill in form fields)

Click **Custom MCP** and fill in each field as follows:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Server Name** | `GoalfyData` |
| **Transport Type** | `HTTP` (keep default) |
| **Icon (optional)** | Leave empty, or paste a logo URL |
| **Notes (optional)** | Leave empty or add a usage description |
| **Server URL** | `https://mcp.goalfydata.ai/mcp` |
| **Custom Headers** | Click "+ Add custom header", add 1 entry |

Custom header (authentication, required):
- Key: `Authorization`
- Value: `Bearer gfk_your_actual_token`

Save when done.

## Step 3: Upload Skill

Go to **Plugins** in the left sidebar -> click **Create** in the top right -> in the Skill area -> **Upload Skill**.

Manus requires uploading a `.zip` or `.skill` file with `SKILL.md` in the root directory.

**Download pre-built ZIP**: Download [goalfydata-skill.zip](https://github.com/GoalfyAI/goalfydata/raw/main/manus/goalfydata-skill.zip) directly and skip to the upload step below.

**Or package manually**:

```bash
cd manus/skill
zip -r goalfydata-skill.zip SKILL.md references/
```

Drag and drop the generated `goalfydata-skill.zip` into the upload area.

Alternatively, you can choose **Import Skill from GitHub**, enter the repository URL `GoalfyAI/goalfydata`, and specify the `manus/skill/` path to import.

Manus automatically registers the skill upon import; you can also invoke it explicitly with `/goalfydata` in a conversation.

## Verification

Connector status shows connected + `goalfydata` appears in Skills -> type "list my datasets" in a conversation to verify.

## Update

### Skill update

The MCP connector points to a remote service and does not need updating. Skill files need to be updated manually:

1. Delete the old `goalfydata` Skill from the Skills management page
2. Re-package and upload the latest `skill/` directory (`zip -r goalfydata-skill.zip SKILL.md references/`)
3. Close the current conversation and open a new one (Skills are only loaded at session start)

### uds-cli update

```bash
uds-cli self-update
```

## Troubleshooting

1. **Server URL must be publicly accessible** -- Manus runs on its own cloud and cannot reach private networks. This is the most common cause of failure.
2. **Token** is incorrect or missing the `Bearer ` prefix.
3. Try `HTTP` for transport type first; if that doesn't work, check if Manus offers a `Streamable HTTP` option.
